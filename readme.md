# Galaxy Generator

## Practice with particles

I far as i learned lots of the particles, I want create something cool like a Galaxy. But instead of producing just one galaxy, let's do a galaxy generator.

For that, we're going to use lil-gui as dat.GUI to let the user tweak the parameters and generate a new galaxy on each change.

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
